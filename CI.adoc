= Travis CI

To build and publish the spec on your gh-pages, create the following
secure environment variables for your repo and send them back in
a pull request on .travis.yml:

* GH_TOKEN="your git token"
* GIT_EMAIL="you@example.com"
* GIT_NAME="you"
* GIT_PUB_REPO="you/specification"
* GIT_PUB_BRANCH="xproc20"

You also have to setup a gh-pages branch, naturally.
